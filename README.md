This project structure is based on the [Angular2]

The project is preconfigured to install the Angular framework, Angular CLI and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.


## Getting Started

__Note__: make sure you have [node][nodejs] version >= 4 installed. We recommend using [node version manager][nvm] to install nodejs and manage node versions.


### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: development tools and app framework code. The development tools help us build and test the application.

* We get the development tools we depend upon and our the app frameworks via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We have configured a list of tasks using [npm][npm] scripts which can be found in `package.json`.


The following tools will need to be installed globally so install them with the `-g` (global) tag:

```
npm install -g typescript protractor angular-cli forever
```

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically install typings for typescript after install so to install all dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `typings install`. You should find that you have two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the dev tools we need as well as our app framework libraries
* `typings` - contains typings for typescript

### Installing Libraries

To install a new library such as bootstrap we can run:

```
npm install bootstrap --save
```

And this will download the bootstrap package using npm and also update `package.json` to include that package.


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To rebuild the app after making changes you can run

```
npm run watch
```

This command will watch all source files and run relevent task when particular files are updated e.g. compiling typescript whenever a typescript file is updated

This will also allow you to browse all the files in the repo on a static server located on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). This is useful for viewing the prototype or coverage folders.

### Running the build script

To create a build to deploy for a production environment simply run:

```
npm run build
```

The build files will then be in the `dist/` directory.

```

## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the angular2-start application: Unit tests and End to End tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The angular2-start app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with [Karma][karma].

* the configuration is found in `config/karma.conf.js`
* the unit tests are found in the same directory as the modules they test and are suffixed with `.spec.ts`.

The easiest way to run the unit tests is:

```
npm test
```


### End to end testing

The angular2-start app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner.  It uses native events and has special features for Angular applications.

* the configuration is found at `protractor.conf.js`
* the end-to-end tests are found in the `e2e` directory and are suffixed with `.e2e.ts`.

Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor can interact with it. To run end to end tests we first need to install protractor with global permissions.

```
npm install -g protractor
```

Then simply run:

```
npm run e2e
```

Behind the scenes this will also run `webdriver-manager update` and `webdriver-manager start`. This will download and install the latest version of the stand-alone WebDriver tool and start the Selenium web server. This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the development server.
